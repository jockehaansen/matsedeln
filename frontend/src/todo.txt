Got it. With a Spring Boot backend, the plan shifts: state + persistence lives server-side, and the frontend becomes a thin client that calls APIs.

Below is the revised scrum plan (still small-app pragmatic, minimal ceremony).

Target architecture (small but solid)
Frontend (React + TS + MUI)

Routes: /login, /dashboard, /recipes (v2)

Auth: store access token (or session cookie) and call API

UI state: mostly “view state”; data comes from API

Backend (Spring Boot)

REST API

PostgreSQL

Validation

Auth with predetermined credentials (no signup)

Migration tool: Flyway (recommended)

Key decisions now (don’t overthink, just pick)
Auth approach (recommended for SPA)

JWT access token:

POST /auth/login with username/password

returns token

frontend sends Authorization: Bearer <token> on requests

Why: simplest SPA-friendly “real” auth without fighting cookies/CSRF.

Predetermined credentials:

Use in-memory user(s) or a seeded DB user

No registration endpoints

Data model (keep it minimal)
v1 entities

Recipe

id, title, proteinType, defaultPortions, (optional: notes)

PlannedMeal (Coming recipes list)

id, recipeId, portionsRemaining, createdAt, status (optional)

PantryItem (Foods available list)

id, name, quantityText (or qty number/unit later)

Budget

id (or singleton), monthlyBudget, spentSoFar

That’s enough to ship the dashboard.

Saved recipes page (v2) can just list Recipe later.

API surface (v1)
Auth

POST /auth/login → { token }

GET /auth/me → optional sanity endpoint

Dashboard data (either 1 aggregated endpoint or separate)

Good enough:

GET /dashboard → { pantryItems, plannedMeals, budget }

Or separate endpoints (also fine):

GET /pantry

GET /planned-meals

GET /budget

Actions you need

Pantry

POST /pantry add item

DELETE /pantry/{id} remove

Planned meals

POST /planned-meals add (by recipeId + starting portions)

PATCH /planned-meals/{id} update portionsRemaining

POST /planned-meals/{id}/finish (or DELETE if “remove from plan”)

Recipes (v1: create only; v2: list/edit)

POST /recipes

GET /recipes (for saved recipes page later)

Budget

PUT /budget set monthly budget

POST /budget/spend add spend

POST /budget/reset optional

Validation: title required, portions >= 0, budget >= 0.

Backlog (Epics → Stories)
Epic 1: Backend foundation

Stories

Spring Boot project with modules: web, security, data-jpa, validation, postgres, flyway

Base config: env vars, profiles (dev, prod)

Health check endpoint

DoD

App runs with Postgres

Flyway creates tables

Epic 2: Auth (predetermined credentials)

Stories

Security config with JWT

Login endpoint returns token

Protect all endpoints except /auth/login and health

DoD

Can’t hit /dashboard without token

Token works from frontend via header

Epic 3: Core domain + CRUD

Stories

Create entities + repositories

Implement pantry endpoints

Implement planned-meals endpoints (portions + finish/remove)

Implement budget endpoints

DoD

All actions persist in DB

Basic validation errors return clean responses

Epic 4: Frontend integration

Stories

Login page calls /auth/login, stores token

Axios client attaches bearer token + handles 401 → redirect login

Dashboard page loads from /dashboard (or 3 endpoints)

Wire UI actions to API:

portions +/- → PATCH

finish/remove → POST/DELETE

add recipe to stack → POST

budget update/spend → PUT/POST

DoD

Full dashboard functionality works end-to-end

Epic 5: Saved recipes page (v2)

Stories

GET /recipes + page showing list

(Optional) edit recipe, tags, search

Sprint plan (practical)
Sprint 1 (Backend boot + auth)

Flyway + Postgres wired

JWT auth + login

Deliverable: you can login and successfully call a protected “hello” endpoint.

Sprint 2 (Domain + endpoints)

Pantry + PlannedMeals + Budget endpoints

Deliverable: Postman/Insomnia can fully operate the dashboard features.

Sprint 3 (Frontend + integration)

React login + protected routing

Dashboard reads from API, actions wired

Deliverable: the app works end-to-end.

Sprint 4 (Polish + v2 seed)

error handling, empty states, optimistic UI

start Saved Recipes page if time
